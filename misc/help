	This is a next generation sequencing data processing pipeline
	for Illumina reads. The software is intended for use with 
	M. tuberculosis genomes.
			
	Main features: snp calling, SV calling, drug resistance, 
		       lineages, gene fusions and targeted analysis

IMPORTANT: the software use positional calls so where you add something is important! Call the script from the directory it is in, we source from our main directory. 

usage: <raw files> <sample names> <output dir> <threads> <ram> <call snps> <call sv's> <call lineage & drug resistance> <reference> <target regions> <verbose>

<raw files>			[DIR]	<directory with raw fastq files, named sample_R1_001.fastq.gz/_R2_001.fastq.gz>
<sample names>			[File]	<List of samples, one sample per line>
<output dir>			[DIR]	<output directory>
<threads>			[INT]	<ammount of cores to allocate>
<ram>				[INT]	<ammount of ram to allocate>
<call snps>			[CHAR]	<TRUE or FALSE>
<call sv's>			[CHAR]	<TRUE or FALSE>
<call lineages>			[CHAR]	<TRUE or FALSE, only for H37Rv as a reference>
<reference>			[CHAR]	<H37Rv or CDC1551, case sensitive enter exactly>
<target regions>		[File]	<list of targets, one per line including identifier start and stop> OR FALSE to skip
<positions>
<verbose>			[CHAR]	<TRUE or FALSE, default is FALSE>
